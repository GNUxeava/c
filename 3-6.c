/* Develop a C program that will determine if a department store customer has exceeded the credit 
 * limit on a charge account. For each customer, the following facts are available:
 * - Account number
 * - Balance at the beginning of the month
 * - Total of all items charged by this customer this month
 * - Total of all credits applied to this customer's account this month
 * - Allowd credit limit
 *
 * The program should input each of these facts, calculate the new balance (= beginning balance + 
 * charges - credits), and determine if the new balance exceeds the customer's credit limit. For
 * those customers whose credit limit is exceeded, the program should display the customer's
 * account number, credit limit, new balance and the message "Credit limit exceeded."
