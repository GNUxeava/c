/* Collecting money becomes increasingly difficult during periods of recession,
 * so companies may tighten their credit limits to prevent their accounts receivable
 * (money owed to them) from becoming too large. In response to prolonged recession,
 * one company has cut its customer's credit limits in half. Thus, if a customer had
 * a credit limit of $2000, this customer's credit limit is now $1000
